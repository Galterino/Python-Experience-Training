Task 1 Message complexity of algorithm: O(n * m)
What needs to be done
Your friend is tired of communicating with simple messages, and he decided to do it in an unusual way: he turns each word in the text upside down, while leaving the punctuation marks intact.
The user enters a text consisting of words and punctuation marks. Write a program that turns (writes in reverse order) all the words in the text, leaving the punctuation marks unchanged. A word in the text is considered to be a sequence of uppercase and lowercase Cyrillic letters.

Example 1:

Message: This task is very important! simple.

New message: sihT ksat si yrev tnatropmi! elpmis.

Message: Although ,. prob:ably not.

New message: hguohtlA ,. ylba:borp ton.
