## 🧩 Task 1 — Message Complexity of Algorithm: **O(n × m)**

### 📝 What Needs to Be Done

Your friend is tired of communicating with simple messages, and he decided to do it in an unusual way: he turns each word in the text upside down, while leaving the punctuation marks intact.  
The user enters a text consisting of words and punctuation marks.  
Write a program that turns (writes in reverse order) all the words in the text, leaving the punctuation marks unchanged.  
A word in the text is considered to be a sequence of uppercase and lowercase Cyrillic letters.

### 💡 Example

---

Message: This task is very important! simple.

New message: sihT ksat si yrev tnatropmi! elpmis.

---

Message: Although ,. prob:ably not.

New message: hguohtlA ,. ylba:borp ton.

## 🚀 Task 2 — The Running Line

### 📝 What Needs to Be Done

In one of your practical work, you wrote a program for the scoreboard that cyclically shifts the elements of a list of numbers to the right by K positions.  
This time you are working with two lines. We need to check if one is actually equal to the other.  
Perhaps one of them is just slightly shifted.

The user enters two lines. Write a program that determines whether the first row can be obtained from the second by cyclic shifting.

**Optional:** if possible, output the value of this shift.

---

### 💡 Example 1

---

First string: abcd
Second string: cdab

The first string can be obtained from the second string by shifting it by 2.

---

### 💡 Example 2

---

First string: abcd
Second string: cdba

The first string cannot be obtained from the second string by cyclic shifting.
